------------------------

Future ideas for the game \
	*Black Hole Ray\ 
		-The cannon will fire a plasma wave different from other cannons \
		-Once it collude with the Astros it will shrink then transform to black hole \
		-Length of time duration and gravitational pool will depend on the size of the asteroid

*Torrent system \
	-Destroying asteroids will generate points that you can use to spawn automatic torrents.
	-The strength of the torrents and coverage will depend on the type of torrent

*Boss asteroid (add boss music ðŸ¤£) \
	-The boss health of the asteroid will be in very immensive and the only way to destroy it would require many torrents.

*Shield for earth
	-Purchasing a shield upgrade for the Earth and shooting at it will allow the Earth to be protected from any asteroids for a limited amount of damage and/time

*Asteroid tracker
	-With the use of a radar system you'd be able to. Is track asteroids from the hood

*Different Maps
On Planet Earth
The Moon
Mars 
Saturn
