Future ideas for the game \
	*Black Hole Ray \
		-The cannon will fire a plasma wave different from other cannons \
		-Once it collude with the Astros it will shrink then transform to black hole \
		-Length of time duration and gravitational pool will depend on the size of the asteroid

*Torrent system \
	-Destroying asteroids will generate points that you can use to spawn automatic torrents. \
	-The strength of the torrents and coverage will depend on the type of torrent

*Boss asteroid (add boss music ðŸ¤£) \
	-Will be the most difficult to destroy and would likely require the help of many torrents.

*Shield for earth \
	-Purchasing a shield upgrade for the Earth \
	-Shooting at the Earth will activate the shield. \
	-This will protect the earth from any asteroids for a limited amount of time and/or damage

*Asteroid tracker \
	-With the use of a radar system you'd be able to. Is track asteroids from the hood

*Different Maps \
On Planet Earth \
The Moon \
Mars \
Saturn \
